## Editor's Words
This project is a task given by my university course (Computer Architecture and Organisation), to build a calculator using logic gates. Since I took the course during my first semester, and I had no experience in deep computer stuff as my previous formal education was not in computer field. I didn't expect I could build a calculator from logic gates, because all I knew about logic gates were input-output signal from OR, AND, XOR, NOT gates, etc. But not what they could really do.

At that time, I could found there were many designs available on the internet which I could just copy and paste, and turn in the project. But I didn't do that, instead I designed it by myself, by googling information. It was really tough as what I learned from class was not up to a standard to be able to build anything. Fortunately, because of my perseverance, in the end, I could made a working but not a perfect calculator. But at least I made it by my own. The project has widen my mind and stimulate my interest in learning deeper about computers.
